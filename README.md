# AdvancedProgramming
An explanation about our program:

First we define a point which has a vector named 'data'.
Then we define a Flower - a point and a type (string).
At the same time we wrote 3 classes - one for each distance formula.
We used the abstruct class "DistanceCalculator" in order to get encapsulation - the 3 classes above extend from the abstruct class.
We wrote the KNNclassifier class - which help us to do the KNN algorithm - it gets a vector of Flowers, k and a flower and return the flower's type according to the KNN algorithm.
