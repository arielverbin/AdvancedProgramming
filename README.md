# AdvancedProgramming
An explanation about our program:

First we define a point which has a data - a pointer to dubble numbers - and  an int variable length
Then we define a Flower - a point and a type.
At the same time we wrote 3 classes - one for each distance formula.
We used the abstruct class "DistanceCalculator" in order to get encapsulation.
We wrote the KNNclassifier class - which help us to do the KNN algorithm - it get's an array of Flowers, k and a flower and return the flower's type according to the KNN algorithm.
